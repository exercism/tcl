# About

Tcl, pronounced "tickle" and short for Tool Command Language, is a
dynamic, open source programming language.

It was designed with the goal of being very simple but powerful.
It is so simple that the entire syntax is fully described in [just 12
rules](https://tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TclCmd/Tcl.htm). Yet it is a 
fully-featured programming language.

Tcl casts everything into *commands*, even variable assignments, procedure definitions and control flow. As such, it
resembles both shell scripting and Lisp.

Tcl supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented,
imperative and functional styles. The most common use-cases of Tcl are as
embedded scripting run-times in C applications, and for prototyping GUIs
using the Tk GUI toolkit.
