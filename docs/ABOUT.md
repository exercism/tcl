# About

Tcl, pronounced "tickle" and short for Tool Command Language, is a dynamic, open source programming language.

It was designed with the goal of being very simple but powerful.
It is so simple that the entire syntax is fully described in [just 12 rules][rules].
Yet it is a fully-featured programming language.

Tcl casts everything into *commands*, even variable assignments, procedure definitions and control flow.
As such, it resembles both shell scripting and Lisp. 

Tcl supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional styles.
The most common use-cases of Tcl are as embedded scripting run-times in C applications, and for prototyping GUIs using the Tk GUI toolkit.

This Exercism track has not (yet) implemented a learning syllabus.
To get started with the Tcl language, I would recommend using [the Tcl tutorial][tutorial] concurrently with solving exercises.
