# Learning

Tcl was designed with the goal of being very simple but powerful.
For that reason, learning [the basic syntax of Tcl][syntax] is quite easy.

For a hands-on tutorial, see [Learn X in Y minutes: Tcl][X-in-Y].

For a comprehensive tutorial in more parts:
 - [The Tcl tutorial][tutorial] covers Tcl version 8.5 (current stable is version 9.0)
 - Support for object oriented programming was added to the Tcl core in verion 8.6.
   Magicsplat has a thorough [OO tutorial][oo-tutorial] covering it.
