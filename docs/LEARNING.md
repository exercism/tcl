# Learning

Tcl was designed with the goal of being very simple but powerful.

For that reason, learning 
[the basic syntax of Tcl](https://www.tcl-lang.org/man/tcl8.6/TclCmd/Tcl.htm)
is quite easy.

For a hands-on tutorial:
 - [Learn X in Y minutes: Tcl](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/tcl/)

For a comprehensive tutorial in more parts:
 - [The Tcl tutorial](https://www.tcl-lang.org/man/tcl8.5/tutorial/tcltutorial.html) covers Tcl version 8.5 (current stable is version 8.6)
 - Support for object oriented programming was added to the Tcl core in verion 8.6.
   [Here is a tutorial](https://www.magicsplat.com/articles/oo.html) covering it.
