# Learning

Tcl was designed with the goal of being very simple but powerful.

For that reason, learning
[the basic syntax of Tcl](https://tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TclCmd/Tcl.htm)
is quite easy.

For a hands-on tutorial:
 - [Learn X in Y minutes: Tcl](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/tcl/)
 - [TclTutor](https://www.noucorp.com/Self-Directed/) is an interactive TCL utility to practice TCL via lessons.

For a comprehensive tutorial in more parts:
 - [The Tcl tutorial](https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/tutorial/tcltutorial.html) covers Tcl version 8.5
   - current stable is version [8.6](https://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/8.6.html), with [9.0](https://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/9.0.html) being released in Q4 2024.
 - Support for object oriented programming was added to the Tcl core in version 8.6.
