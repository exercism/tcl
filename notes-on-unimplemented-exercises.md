[Unimplemented exercises in Tcl](https://tracks.exercism.io/tcl/master/unimplemented) on the Exercism Track maintenance tool.

* [hangman](https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications/tree/master/exercises/hangman)
    - intended to work with [Functional Reactive Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming)
    - don't know if there is such a package available for Tcl
    - otherwise, it's a fairly boring string manipulation exercise
* [ledger](https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications/tree/master/exercises/ledger)
    - a tedious-to-create refactoring exercise
* [lens-person](https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications/tree/master/exercises/lens-person)
    - Tcl does not have immutable data
* [micro-blog](https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications/tree/master/exercises/micro-blog)
    - Default builds of tclsh cannot handle emojis
    - see [Unicode and UTF-8](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/Unicode+and+UTF-8)
