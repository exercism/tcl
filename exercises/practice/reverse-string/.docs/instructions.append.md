## Tcl-specific instructions

There are a couple of builtin commands that make this exercise trivial:

* [`string reverse`](https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/TclCmd/string.htm#M43)
* [`lreverse`](https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/TclCmd/lreverse.html)

Try to implement this yourself without using those "cheats".
