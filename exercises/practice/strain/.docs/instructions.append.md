# dummy

## Tcl-specific instructions

This exercise gets you to write your own control command (like `foreach` or `while`).
You will need the [`upvar`][upvar] and [`uplevel`][uplevel] commands.

The `uplevel` man page contains an example `do ... while ...` control construct which should help you solve this exercise.

This discussion on the Tcl wiki, [New Control Structures][wiki], may also be helpful.
